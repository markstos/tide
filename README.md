**The ultimate Fish prompt.**

- **Out of the box:** With four compelling styles and lots of options, you can have your ready-to-run cake and customize it too.
- **Flexible:** Move content around or remove it, all without ever touching a line of code.
- **Extensible:** Create custom content with simple fish functions that integrate seamlessly.
- **Fast:** Asynchronous rendering makes Tide the fastest full-featured fish prompt.

### Flexible

Using the [`items`][] list for each side of the prompt, you have full control of which and where prompt sections display.

### Asynchronous Rendering

Tide runs everything in the background so that your prompt will always feel snappy.

![async][]

Asynchronous rendering also allows Tide to display more information than other prompts. For example, most prompts don't display the number of untracked, modified, or deleted files in a git repository because it's too slow to compute.

### Multi-Line Right Prompt

> Fish can't do _that_ yet can it!

Tide is the only Fish prompt capable of displaying a multi-line right prompt. All you have to do is add the `newline` item.

## Fonts

### Meslo Nerd Font

Gorgeous monospace font designed by Jim Lyles for Bitstream, customized for Apple, enhanced by André Berg, and finally patched by Roman Perepelitsa of [Powerlevel10k][] with scripts originally developed by Ryan McIntyre of [Nerd Fonts][]. Contains all the glyphs and symbols that Tide may need. Battle-tested in dozens of different terminals on all major operating systems.

### Font Installation

Download these four ttf files:

- [MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf][]
- [MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf][]
- [MesloLGS NF Italic.ttf][]
- [MesloLGS NF Bold Italic.ttf][]

Open each file and click "Install". This will make the `MesloLGS NF` font available to all applications on your system. Configure your terminal to use this font.
